<h1>FCC Nutrition Label</h1>
A nutrition label. This project helped me learn typography and how to style text more effectively.

<h3>Biggest Challenge</h3>
This project was extremely tedious and repetitive. Now that I understand how typography works, I would have taken a different approach with some of the CSS decisions. I'd reduce the number of classes required to make this work.
<br>
<h3>Biggest Takeaway</h3>
Everything is a box in web design. A box can be manipulated if you know which property will create the change you want. This was probably my least favorite project. Hopefully, I can make typography changes quickly in the future.
